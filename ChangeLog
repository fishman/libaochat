Sat Jan 17 19:22:40 CET 2004 - 1.1.0-rc4
----------------------------------------
* docs/group_id.txt describes GroupIDs
* New "example", examples/3_skel (skeleton) [not finished in rc4!]
* aocTellQueue has been replaced by aocMsgQueue.
* NEW: Packet rate limiter. aocSetPref(AOC_PREF_PKTLIMIT, (void *)20);
* The event queue has been redesigned and simplified. All connections
  now share the same event queue, and you can add your own events with
  aocEventAdd().
* aocConnections now have a user data union called 'udata'
* NEW: (aocHashList *)->count = number of nodes in table.
* NEW: New packet type: AOC_TYPE_RAW. (raw binary data)
* NEW: AOC_SRV_FORWARD and AOC_SRV_AMD_MUX_INFO packets are now supported.
  AOC_SRV_FORWARD is decoded as "r" [Unknown(raw)]
  AOC_SRV_AMD_MUX_INFO is decoded as "III" [Array(int) Array(int) Array(int)]
* moo_trand() now uses rand() to further randomize it's data
* AOC_SRV_GROUP_JOIN packets are now decoded as "gswws" [grpid str wrd wrd str]
* Lots of small changes, code cleanups, etc...
* Bumped library version to 2.0.0.
* Updated the documentation...

Thu Jan 15 16:21:08 CET 2004 - 1.0.5
------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug in aocPushString()
* The tell queue will now destroy it's timer when the queue is empty.
* aocPush*(), aocPacketInit(), and aocPacketSend() are now defined
  in the header file. These functions can be used to create custom packets.
* aocReadPacket() has been rewritten, and is now more efficient.
* Removed printf() spam from aocSendChatCommand :P
* NEW: aocDecodeBlob(), aocNameListSetDataByName(),
  aocNameListSetDataByUID().
* Timers are aligned on 25ms intervals.
* Timers inserts are on average 50% faster.
* Fixed memory leak in tell queue.
* Prevent 0 size malloc in tell queue.
* The 'received packet' debug msg was reporting the wrong packet length.
* The EINTR signal is ignored on recv()/send().
* Minor cleanups...

Thu Oct 30 15:04:55 CET 2003 - 1.0.4
------------------------------------
* Fixed a send queue bug which I fixed in 1.0.0 but somehow
  I must have managed to overwrite it with an older copy. :/
* NEW: aocMakeItemBlob(), aocMakeBlob()
* Updated the documentation...

Sun Oct 26 12:10:20 CEST 2003 - 1.0.3
-------------------------------------
* FIX: Group IDs are now declared as unsigned char * everywhere. Really.
* BUG: aocSendChatCommand() was not pushing the array size.
* Changed function paramters to const where possible.
* Fixed a recv() issue with WSAASyncSelect() (bug?) [Windows]
* Cleaned up aocMakeWndBlob()
* FIX: Charnames sent to the server are now trimmed. (aocSendNameLookup())
* NEW: aocNameTrim() - trims up to 128 bytes of a string (incl. NULL),
                       returns a static pointer.
* aocNameLowerCase() now converts up to 128 bytes. (incl. NULL)
* Updated the 1_charlist and windows_polling examples.
* Updated the documentation.

Wed Oct 22 00:36:15 CEST 2003 - 1.0.2
-------------------------------------
* BUG: Use OPENSSL_free on pointers returned from BN_bn2hex()
* FIX: New function: aocFree() - this must be used when freeing
       memory pointers returned by libaochat functions.
       Ie. from aocKeyexGenerateKey(), aocInit(NULL), and aocMemDup()
       Using free() instead of aocFree() can corrupt the heap.
* BUG: Fixed a bug in the win32gendef.sh script that prevented
       some functions from being listed. [Windows]
* Updated the documentation.
* NEW: Added win32 support & makefiles for example 1 and 2. [Windows]
* The library has been tested under the following platforms:
  FreeBSD 4.9-PRERELEASE (i386)
  Linux 2.2 (i386, alpha64)
  Linux 2.4 (amd64)
  Linux 2.6 (i386)
  NetBSD 1.6.1 (i386)
  Windows 2000 (i386)
* FIX: Check for BN_mod_exp in -lcrypto rather than -lssl
* NEW: aocSetPref() preference: AOC_PREF_FASTRND

Fri Oct 17 15:57:56 CEST 2003 - 1.0.1
-------------------------------------
* BUG: Fixed stoopid aocSendGroup* groupid bug
* FIX: Group IDs are now declared as unsigned char * everywhere.
* Greatly improved the tell queue code.
* Minor autoconf changes
* FIX: The HTML doc builder will actually generate valid
       xhtml/1.0 strict now.
* FIX: Fixed typos, etc.. in docs
* FIX: You can now pass -1 as text_len/blob_len to aocTellQueueAdd()

Mon Oct 06 23:25:52 CEST 2003 - 1.0.0
