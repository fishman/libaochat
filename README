==============================================================================
What is libaochat and what are it's features?
==============================================================================
libaochat is a free Anarchy Online Chat library for Unix, Linux and Windows.
It is written in C and licensed under the GNU General Public License.
(Note: That's GPL, not LGPL! You can't link this library with closed source
 software. Why? Because keyex.c is licensed under GPL. If the author [auno]
 decides to change the license of keyex.c to LGPL or the BSD license I will
 also change the license of libaochat.)

libaochat features:
* Easy to use polling functions
* Asynchronous socket I/O
* Automatic send queueing
* Outgoing bandwidth/packet rate limiting
* Timer functions
* Stack functions (FIFO and LIFO)
* Hash table functions designed for fast UserID <-> CharName lookups
* Lookup table functions designed for GroupID <-> GroupName lookups
* Per connection event system
* Various utility functions
* Cheezy documentation

==============================================================================
Compiling and installing the library on Unix and Linux

==============================================================================
Compiling and installing the library on MS Windows (stand-alone)
==============================================================================
You're going to need Microsoft's Visual Studio .NET C/C++ compiler (or another
win32 compiler, but that's what I used), some coding knowledge, and a properly
compiled GMP or OpenSSL library. You will also need to edit the
files win32autoconf.h, and Makefile.win32.

C:\libaochat-1.1.0\> nmake /f Makefile.win32
C:\libaochat-1.1.0\> copy aochat.dll c:\windows\system32

You will also need to copy the aochat.lib and aochat.h files to your
library and include directory respectively. :p
